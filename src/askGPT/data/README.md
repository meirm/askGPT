## Usage

These files are packaged with the application and loaded at runtime. They can be accessed:

   - Welcome message: Shown on startup or with `/welcome`
   - Tips: Can be added as a future `/tips` command
   - Shortcuts: Can be added as a future `/shortcuts` command

2. **From the file system**:
   - Located in the package at `src/askgpt/data/`
   - Can be customized by editing the files directly

## Customization

To customize these files:
1. Edit the markdown files in this directory
2. Rebuild/reinstall the package if needed
3. Changes will take effect on next run

## Adding New Data Files

To add new data files:
1. Create a new `.md` file in this directory
2. Import and use it in the application code
3. Consider adding a command to access it from interactive mode
